### About Me

I have over 10 years of experience working as an environmental engineer in two large companies in the field of environmental protection. During this time, I developed valuable skills in data analysis, cross-functional teamwork, reporting, working under tight deadlines, and managing industrial-scale projects.

After relocating and with a strong desire to grow my software skills, I began training as a front-end developer. My goal is to combine my environmental expertise with IT to contribute to the development of meaningful digital solutions and applications aimed at environmental improvement and sustainable development.

### Front-End Development Training

_Rolling Scopes School — ongoing_

Fully immersed in the learning process, actively building practical skills and working on real-world projects.

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, BEM, Git, Vite / Webpack / Parcel, NPM / Yarn, REST API / Fetch / Axios, Responsive & Adaptive layout.

**Kata Training from Codewars:**

In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.

**Example**

filter_list([1,2,'a','b']) == [1,2] \
filter_list([1,'a','b',0,15]) == [1,0,15]\
filter_list([1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]) == [1,2,123]

**Solution**:

```
function filter_list(l) {
  let result = [];
  for (let item  of l) {
    if (typeof item === 'number') {
      result.push(item)
    }
  }
  return result
}
console.log(filter_list([1,2,'a','b']))

// Test Results:
Log
[ 1, 2 ]
```
