#### About Me

I have over 10 years of experience working as an environmental engineer in two large companies in the field of environmental protection. During this time, I developed valuable skills in data analysis, cross-functional teamwork, reporting, working under tight deadlines, and managing industrial-scale projects.

After relocating and with a strong desire to grow my software skills, I began training as a front-end developer. My goal is to combine my environmental expertise with IT to contribute to the development of meaningful digital solutions and applications aimed at environmental improvement and sustainable development.
