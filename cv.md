### About Me


Experience as an environmental engineer in the oil & gas and automotive industries. Responsible for environmental data analysis, technical documentation and reporting, project management, and cross-functional collaboration.

After a company exit led to my position being made redundant, I decided to change my professional path and start a career in IT.

I’m inspired by the opportunity to combine my environmental expertise with digital technologies and contribute to solutions that support sustainability. My goal is to grow as a frontend developer in green IT and build services that make the environment both smarter and cleaner.

### Frontend development training


_Rolling Scopes School — ongoing_

Fully immersed in the learning process, actively building practical skills and working on real-world projects.

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, BEM, Git, Vite / Webpack / Parcel, NPM / Yarn, REST API / Fetch / Axios, Responsive & Adaptive layout.

**Kata Training from Codewars:**

In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.

**Example**

filter_list([1,2,'a','b']) == [1,2] \
filter_list([1,'a','b',0,15]) == [1,0,15]\
filter_list([1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]) == [1,2,123]

**Solution**:

```
function filter_list(l) {
  let result = [];
  for (let item  of l) {
    if (typeof item === 'number') {
      result.push(item)
    }
  }
  return result
}
console.log(filter_list([1,2,'a','b']))

// Test Results:
Log
[ 1, 2 ]
```
